# Putnam Trainer (will think of a better name)
A simple website to practice Putnam problems on. Problems are scraped from AoPS forums and the website is made with
NextJS and vibecoding. Your progress is saved locally with IndexedDB.

# TODO for Copilot
- Random problem functionality -> add option to choose random problem among marked and/or unmarked problems
- Show/hide problem number
- Pick specific problem (year, (A/B)(1/2/3/4/5/6))
- Display entire exam for a year
- Latex rendering
- Mark problems as solved and display it
